# Final-Project
This is my final project for the AP CS A class in Grade 11.

This project demonstrates the capabilities of machine learning and how it trains itself via trial and error to master a simple game. The code shows the actions of each of the characters the brain uses to try different stratagies as well as any connections made in the barin as to what parameters lead to what outputs. Thus, this code can visualize the brain. 
The future of this project could include either improving the ML code to take less time to train itself, as currently, many generations and a high population count ÅŸs required to train the general algorithm or to change the game. ML is a highly adaptive piece of software and could be adapted to more useful or challanging scenarios. An example could be future stock prediction, as ML learn from previous actions of a stock price and predicts the future possibilities.
The main purpose I chose this project was to take a deep dive into ML code. In hindsight however, this may have not been a great idea. It is better to first take some classes and learn the basics of ML before trying to understand and implement the code on its own.
